# AssertJson #

Test your JSON strings.

## Installation ##

```sh
cd path/to/your/rails-project
./script/plugin install git://github.com/alto/assert_json.git
```

Or if you prefer [bundler](http://getbundler.com)

```sh
# in your Gemfile
gem 'assert_json'
```


## Usage ##

```ruby
class MyActionTest < ActionController::TestCase
  include AssertJson

  def test_my_action
    get :my_action, :format => 'json'
    # => @response.body= '{"key":[{"inner_key1":"value1"},{"inner_key2":"value2"}, {'special-key': null}]}'

    assert_json(@response.body) do
      has :key do
        has :inner_key1, 'value1'
        has :inner_key2, /lue2/
      end
      has 'special-key', nil
      has_not :key_not_included
    end
  end

end
```

Arrays are little bit special. If you want to test single items (or skip others) you
use `item(i)` to select the item to test, like this

```ruby
assert_json '[{"id":1, "key":"test", "name":"test"}, {"id":2, "key":"test", "name":"test"}, {"id":3, "key":"test", "name":"test"}]' do
  item 0 do
    has :id, 1
    has :key, 'test'
    has :name, 'test'
  end
  item 2 do
    has 'id', 3
  end
end
```
